Little game, where you solve a set of levels using the esoteric programming language Brainfuck.

If you are stuck on a level download the folder "BrainfuckTheGame" and place it in the same folder as the Brainfuck.jar file.

Game was created for the Ludum Dare competition, where you only have 2 days to create a game.
Due to the nature of said competition, game was rushed and the code isn't the best for learning.
